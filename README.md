# nvim-env
This repo holds my configuration for neovim.

I am very new to vim, I based much of this off of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdn_pKJUda8&list=PLnu5gT9QrFg36OehOdECFvxFFeMHhb_07&index=3&pp=iAQB

## How to install

**iTerm 2 in recommened for this!**

1. Clone the repo
1. Copy the `nvim` folder into `~/.config`
1. Relaunch terminal and open `nvim`


## tmux
I added the tmux conf file to this project as well. This file should be copied directly into `~`
